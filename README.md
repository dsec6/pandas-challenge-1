## Project Tasks
The project is divided into four main parts:

1. **Explore the Data**: Examine the dataset structure and basic statistics.
2. **Transform the Data**: Create new columns for subtotals, shipping prices, total prices, costs, and profits.
3. **Confirm the Work**: Verify calculations against provided order totals.
4. **Summarize and Analyze**: Create summary statistics for top clients and analyze the findings.

## Results
The main findings of the analysis are summarized in the notebook. Key insights include:
